Failure Detectors
=================
- What is a failure detector? An entity in a distributed system that determines when a node has failed.
- Reliable failure detector: always says alive nodes are alive, and dead nodes as dead
- Unreliable failure detector: sometimes says alive nodes are dead, and vice versa
- The question: can we build reliable distributed systems using unreliable failure detectors?
- Turns out we can!
- In an asynchronous model, achieving Consensus and Atomic Broadcast are impossible
  - But are possible if we add unreliable failure detectors into the mix
- Failure detector properties:
  - Completeness: a failure detector must mark as failed all failed nodes eventually
  - Accuracy: a failure detector doesn't mark alive nodes as dead
- Weakest useful failure detector:
  - After time T1, all failed nodes are marked as dead
  - After time T2, all alive nodes are marked alive 
  - A distributed application built on top of this has safety, but may not have liveness
- Completeness variants:
  - Strong completeness: every failure detector marks every crashed node as failed
  - Weak completeness: some failure detector marks every crashed node as failed
- Accuracy variants:
  - Strong accuracy: no nodes are incorrectly marked as failed
  - Weak accuracy: some nodes are never incorrectly marked as failed
- Practically, we want some T after which weak accuracy holds (eventual weak accuracy)
- Perfect failure detector: strong completeness + strong accuracy

Practical failure detection
===========================
- What is a simple way to detect failure?
  - Send a node a message
  - If it doesn't reply in time T, mark node has failed
- Problem with this approach: how to determine T
  - T too low: alive nodes marked as dead, distributed system does un-necessary protocols
  - T too high: whole system waiting to proceed after a node has died
- T is set experimentally today, and this approach is used in most distributed systems
- Node X sends message to node Y with timeout T, no reply in T, marks Y as failed
  - if Y later replies, X increases T, but only for Y
- This failure detector has the properties of the weakest useful failure detector  

RAPID
=====
- Distributed membership service
- Provides "stable" failure detection: membership doesn't oscillate in the face of failures
- Uses an expander-based monitoring edge overlay
- Uses a multi-process cut detection
